                <p>The mission of our library services is to facilitate the creation of new knowledge through acquisition, organization, and dissemination of knowledge resources.
                    The University Libraries offer a wide range of materials in a variety of formatsâ€”from traditional books and serials to films, and multimedia and networked information from around the world. Highly skilled staff assists students to use the local collections and find information on specific topics. Our libraries are a learning space where students are inspired to explore research and create. Our libraries are not only the places to think but also an informal work area where students gather to collaborate.
                    Learning Resource Centres at Chitkara University comprise the central library and ten departmental libraries. The Library committee has put up policy and budget in place so that the same is adequately stacked at all times for use by the students and faculty.
                    All libraries are Wi-Fi enabled and have state-of-the-art computerized machines and digital tablets to provide easy access to our online resources. Critical functions of the library viz., registration of visitors, issue/return of books, accession records of all hard copy resources, and Online Public Access Catalog (OPAC), are fully automated by barcoding of all the books and easy scan bar code readers. Need-based reprography services viz. printing, photocopying, and scanning are also available in the library.</p>
